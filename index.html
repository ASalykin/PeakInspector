        <p>
            PeakInspector represents a simple standalone application for interactive analysis of peak properties in time-series data.
            PeakInspector allows to preprocess data before the analysis by baseline normalising, linear detrending (optionally) and smoothing data
            (by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter">Savitzky–Golay filter</a>). For the full list of a peak
            properties which could be currently analysed by PeakInspector please refer to <a href="#peak_features">this</a> checklist.

        <h3>
            Requirements
        </h3>
        <p>
            PeakInspector is written in Python 3.x, and generally platform-independent. The following packages are required:
            <ul>
                <li>PyQt4</li>
                <li>numpy</li>
                <li>scipy</li>
                <li>matplotlib</li>
            </ul>

            It is recommended to install <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda package</a>
             which already contains all required packages.

            For better experience it is recommended to work with PeakInspector on monitor with FullHD resolution (1920x1080).

        </p>


        <h3>
            Installation
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to use PeakInspector by simple downloading the archive (on the top page), or clone this repository.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Working with PeakIspector
        </h3>
        <p>Explanation of every option on the graphical interface could be obtained by simple cursor-over the option and waiting for 1-2 seconds.
        Explanation tip will automatically pop-up.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Load data</h4></li>

                    <p>
                        Data file could be loaded by simple click on <b>"Load file"</b> button. File should be in text format, and contain
                        1 (time invariant, data indeces will be considered on time scale) or
                        2 columns of data (in case specifically recorded time). Delimiter between columns could be explicitly chosen.

                        If data contain header, or any additional information at the beginning or end of the file one could skip this rows by
                        specifying how many rows to skip.

                        Data will be loaded and preprocessed automatically.

                    <p>
                        Dy default the option <b>"Detrend data"</b> is enabled. As well as some options for Savitzky–Golay filter are also specified.
                        If not needed, user can disable <b>"Detrend data"</b> option, as well as change parameters for Savitzky–Golay filter.
                        To see the changed graphical ouput user have to press the <b>"Replot"</b> button.

                    <p>
                        The general procedure of peak analysis include clicking by the left mouse button near the peak local maximum
                        (with enabled option <b>"Enable peak choosing"</b>). PeakInspector automatically search for the true local peak maximum
                        (taking into account the option <b>"Peak detection window"</b>, which specifies the "distance" in data points withing
                        which the peak maximum will be searched from the initial user click). Along with that, PeakInspector will try to find where peak starts and ends,
                        and calculate properties of the peak, which include:
                        <ul><a name="peak_features"></a>
                            <li>Time of the peak maximum</li>

                            <li>Time of the peak end</li>
                            <li>Peak start value (ordinate)</li>
                            <li>Peak end vale (ordinate)</li>
                            <li>Absolute amplitude (A, according to the normalized baseline, which is 0)</li>

                            <li>Relative amplitude relative to the maximal relative amplitude among all peaks in current data</li>
                            <li>Period (P, time between 2 nearest peak maxima)</li>
                            <li>Frequency (1/P, just value, opposite to period)</li>

                            <li>AUC (area under the curve, or peak area)</li>

                            <li>Frequency (Hz) of medium peaks in current data file (with absolule amplitude >=0.33 and <0.66)</li>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        User can interactively move the peak borders (start and end points of the peak) by simply drag
                        the corresponding point by right mouse button, or explicitly point to the region where it shoud be
                        by pressing <b>CTRL+Right mouse button</b> for the peak start, and <b>ALT+Right mouse button</b> for the peak end point.
                    </p>
                <li><h4>Save ouput</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        All files analysed are considered as a batch (one treatment, one biological repetition, etc), and
                        clicking on the button <b>"Analyse and save file"</b> save currenly analysed file into table inside PeakInspector,
                        and add it to previously analysed files from the same batch. To save the all analysed peak from the batch as a table
                        (for now the default output is Excel file) user have to click the <b>"Export analysed files to Excel"</b>.
